# Housing Price Prediction
Here we build a machine learning model to predict house prices for a fictitious real estate company called Dragon Real Estate.

## Objective
Dragon Real Estate (fictitious) has hired us as a Data Science Engineer to predict the house prices and we are given a data set with the house prices according to the relevant features.

Data Dictionary - Feature / Attribute Information:

    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds
